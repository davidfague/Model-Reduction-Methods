# Model Reduction Methods
 
Repository for neuronal modeling reduction techniques. Check additional README's for specifics on each method.

Includes:
neuron_reduce for reducing a realistic dendritic tree to an equivalant cable.
cable_expand for going from an equivalent cable to an ideal dendritic tree.

Rall's theory for accurately equating a dendritic tree to a cable relies on 5 assumptions. 
Some amount of these assumptions may not be fully true in nature, resulting in some inequivalence between cable and tree.
These assumptions are:
